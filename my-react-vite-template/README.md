# My React Vite Template

this code returns "Hello from App" on the homepage.

## How to Clone

run this bad boy in your terminal...

<dont tell anyone you read this>

```sh
npx tiged juliatdunc/my-react-vite-template#main my-new-vite-template
```

This command will create a clone of the repo' `main` branch under the name
my-new-vite-template in the directory where it is run.

## How to install

run these bad boys in your terminal...

```sh
cd my-react-vite-template
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` runs the `dev` script from your __package.json__; you will run
this command whenever you want to start your app. When it runs, you should see
something like this in the terminal:

```bash
VITE v4.5.0  ready in 592 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```

> __Note:__ The `Local` line might also read `http://localhost:5173/` (which
> resolves to `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`).

Open a browser to [http://localhost:5173]. (Typing `o` in the terminal where
Vite is running will open a browser window to that address.)

go to index.html and change the title inner text to a title of your choosing
also go ahead and change that there README to be something else. `High Five`
